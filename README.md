<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Numerical Python, or Numpy, is one of the most widely used open-source numerical computing Python packages available today. Most scientific computing packages, such as scikit-learn, rely on NumPy's array objects as the format for data exchange.

This tutorial will discuss core NumPy functionalities, including:
- fast vectorised array operations for data cleaning, filtering, and transformation;
- common array algorithms such as sorting, unique, and set operations;
- descriptive statistics and aggregating data; and
- data manipulation for merging and joining together datasets.
